<p style='text-align: justify;'> This repository is created to develop an automated medical emergencies management and alert mechanism (MEMAM) tool for corporate hospitals using dynamic programming approaches in python. The core motivation of this project is to leverage fundamentals of python programming to achieve  a fully-functional commercial hospital management software. MEMAM is a specialized tool to handle the critical emergencies identified by the bedside monitors for real-time observation of the patients’ vitals in a hospital setting. MEMAM has in-built features to replicate pager machines using a custom built GUI to comprehensively visualize the paging protocols and activities typically executed by the nurses’ operation centers at corporate hospitals. A dynamic auto-update of database with lists of available attending surgeons, residents, resident interns and equipment units has been exclusively employed to further demonstrate the scope of MEMAM as a real-world application in hospitals. 
The code is documented in PEP8 style formatting with clear comments and designed to be easy to extend. If you use it in your research, please consider citing this repository.
